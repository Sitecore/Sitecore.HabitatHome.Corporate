The Sitecore.HabitatHome.Utilities repository is a collection of useful utilities and script examples to help in the context of the Habitat Home Demos, of which one is this Habitat Home Corporate site.

- ***URL Rewrite module***

As part of the Habitat Corporate installation, a IIS URL rewrite rule is added to the web.config file in order to enforce HTTPS requests on the website. Please ensure you have this module installed or you will receive a 500.19 error after deployment (https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite).
